# Limelightplatform
This project was written from scratch by Nathan Bunney for the Limelight Platform interview process

## Notes
* I decided to take a little more time and complete all the exercises, so this should be complete.
* The only content which called for data specific to the user was the todo section, so the others contain all data available.
* I added TailwindCSS to the project late in the process to pull in an easy modal window.  I love Tailwind, but most of the classes are just my own so don't expect to see a lot of it outside of that one modal.
* The sketch for posts seemed to show a lot more than the body of the posts, so I added the comments in there as well.
* I went back and forth on whether to disable the checkbox on the Todos tab.  I ended up disabling them since there was no instructions for changing them.
